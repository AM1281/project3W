                    <h2>Welcome to RentABook!</h2>
                    <p class="featurep">RentABook is a virtual book rental system developed for the students of the university of Thessaly.<br>
                        The goal of this web site is simple, all students should have the books for their courses.<br>
                        How can we achieve this? This is where the students' help is required.<br>
                        Each student can offer one or more books for rent, those books become available in this site,<br> so that other students 
                        can make a request to rent them.<br>
                       The owner of a book can then choose who to rent the book to based on user's feedback.
                    </p>                     
                </div>
                <div class="feature">
                    <h2>Ready to give and take?</h2>
                    <p class="featurep">Now that you know what this is about you can go ahead and request to rent an available book 
                        or if you feel generous you can offer your book(s) for rent.
                        Since this is an application used from students of the University of Thessaly you dont need to 
                        create a new account. You can login with your academic credentials!!
                        It's really easy just  <a style=color:#F38630; href="login.jsp">login</a> and you are ready to go!<br>
                        Remember that every user has a rating for feedback so 
                        you should check it first and then decide you if you want to rent from or to  him/her .
